# Clustering-a-genetic-fingerprint-dataset
The task for this problem set was to analyze a genetic fingerprint dataset consisting of 512 vectors & find the optimal number of clusters that the dataset can be grouped into. 
We clustered the data using various values of k, and used the ‘inertia’ metric, ‘silhouette’ metric & ‘silhouette diagram’ to decide on the optimal number of clusters. 
In this process, we also compared which k-means initialization options ‘k-means++’ or ‘random’ works best in our case.
